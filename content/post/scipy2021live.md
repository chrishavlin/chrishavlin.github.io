SciPy2021 is live! This year I'm involved in a couple presentations, check them out:

* Sam Walkow's poster on using a schema-based approach in data visualization, ["Towards a Scientific Workflow Description: a yt Project Prototype for Interdisciplinary Analysis"](https://samwalkow.github.io/2021-scipy-poster-ScientificWorkflowDescription/)
* My own poster on ["On the Daskening of yt"](https://chrishavlin.github.io/scipy2021/), showing the latest state of our efforts to leverage Dask within yt!
