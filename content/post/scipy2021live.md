SciPy2021 is live! This year I'm involved in a couple presentations, check them out below!

### schema-based visualization

Sam Walkow's poster, [Towards a Scientific Workflow Description: a yt Project Prototype for Interdisciplinary Analysis](https://samwalkow.github.io/2021-scipy-poster-ScientificWorkflowDescription/), demonstrates a workflow that allows a user to build visualizations with yt using descriptive JSON files. The JSON's validating schema is built on a pydantic representation of the yt API and opens up a ton of cool approaches for building yt plots interactively.

### Dask and yt

My own poster on [On the Daskening of yt](https://chrishavlin.github.io/scipy2021/) shows the latest state of our efforts to leverage Dask within yt: a more complete unyt-dask array, some performance tests of a Daskified particle reader and Daskified sampling routines within the yt API!
