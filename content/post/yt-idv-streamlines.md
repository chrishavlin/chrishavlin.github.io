I've been working on and off on adding support to [yt_idv](https://github.com/yt-project/yt_idv) for plotting arbitrary curves along with the other rendering elements. My plan is to use this for some volume rendering of seismic images as a way to add outlines of the earth's surface to the images. But the example I wrote up for the new feature shows a more common use-case for the astro applications: plotting streamlines!
