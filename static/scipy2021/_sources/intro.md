The yt package provides a powerful suite of analysis and visualization tools for the physical sciences. In addition to expanding yt into a more domain-agnostic tool, a number of ongoing efforts seek to better leverage advancements from across the Python open source ecosystem within yt's infrastructure. In this work, we present our efforts to incorporate Dask within the yt codebase to handle both lazy serial and parallel workflows, improving both the developer and end-user experience. We compare both user experience and performance between yt's existing serial and MPI-parallel processing methods and their "Daskified" counterparts.
